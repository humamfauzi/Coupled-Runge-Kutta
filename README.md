# Coupled-Runge-Kutta
Solving Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) using Runge Kutta method including coupled ODE

### Welcome 

This repository is a total runge kutta repository. All runge-kutta method including Euler, Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg, and Heuns method. All of Runge-Kutta method can be coupled thus can solve many related equation in one go. Equation such as Lotka Voltera prey predator model and charged particle projection using Lorentz Equation. All are tested and go well

Next project is completing the adaptive Runge-Kutta such as Cash-Karp and Dormand-Prince. There is wrong with step size $h$ refinement. It means a lot if you want to fix it. I believe there is much improvement that can be done especially functions name and variable name. Many of variable names are named without thinking throughly. I plan to use IPython notebook to explain Runge Kutta throughly.

I accept all corrections and suggestions. Please feel free to ask me. My aim is to provide a reliable coupled Runge Kutta method for everyone.
